# What's this project/fork?

This is a fork making minor modifications and additions to the [Shiny Profiler](https://github.com/aidinabedi/shinyprofiler) project by [aidinabedi](https://github.com/aidinabedi) on GitHub. There's a new CMakeLists file in the main directory for compiling specifically for UWP setups and some minor changes to allow the preprocessor `SHINY_HAS_ENABLED` variable to compile properly elsewhere in `ShinyManager.c`. 

Otherwise, the rest of the very usable library has remained untouched!

Remainder of the README below is from the original repo:

# What is Shiny?

Shiny is a lightning fast, fully documented and by far the-easiest-to-use-ever C/C++/Lua high-performance profiler with no extensive surgery for your existing projects. Results are smoothed and shown in run-time as a call-tree or sorted-by-time. Output is also renderable as graphs in Ogre3D and easily customized to any other graphics engine!

* Very very low overhead, extremely powerful and accurate high speed profiling
* Amazingly simple-to-use & flexible interface with lots of examples and docs
* Results are elegantly shown as call-graph or sorted-by-time and readable in run-time code
* On-the-fly smoothing averages for scientific or main-loop projects like game engines
* Rendering history graphs & nicely colored output in OGRE 3D or your custom engine
* Clean platform-independent, object-oriented and free-for-any-purpose source code

# Quotes

"It took me 3 minutes to get it to work, compiling included, and to get the results I wanted."

"Basically a super-simple code profiler that just works and helped fix my slowdowns."

"The most flexible profiler I've used so far, I really recommend it."
